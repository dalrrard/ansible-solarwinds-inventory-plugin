## About

The Ansible Solarwinds Inventory Plugin was built to allow you to use your preexisting Solarwinds NCM inventory information to run Ansible playbooks against. 

### Built With

This project was built and tested using Python 3.9 and Ansible 4.8.0 (ansible-core 2.11.6) though earlier versions should work with minimal to no tweaking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This plugin currently uses the Cirrus.Nodes table from Solarwinds NCM using the [Solarwinds Information Service (SWIS)](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/wiki/About-SWIS). In the future, the ability to pull information from Orion may be added.

### Installation

You can install this plugin in a few ways. The most straightforward is to add the plugin locally as described in [these instructions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_locally.html#adding-a-plugin-locally). For convenience, this is how you can add it to your user's home directory in Linux.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/plugins/inventory

cd ~/.ansible/plugins/inventory

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dalrrard/ansible-solarwinds-inventory-plugin/main/solarwinds.py
```

You can verify that Ansible sees the plugin by running this command:

```bash
ansible-doc -t inventory solarwinds
```

## Usage

To use this plugin, you'll need to create a file named any of these names:
  
  * `solarwinds_inventory.yaml`
  * `solarwinds_inventory.yml`
  * `solarwinds.yaml`
  * `solarwinds.yml`
  
The information below is mandatory information to put in the file.

```yaml
---
plugin: solarwinds
base_url: https://<server-fqdn-or-ip>
username: <vault encrypted username for Solarwinds>
password: <vault encrypted password for Solarwinds>
```

This details all available options.

```yaml
---
plugin: solarwinds
base_url: https://<server-fqdn-or-ip>
username: <vault encrypted username for Solarwinds>
password: <vault encrypted password for Solarwinds>
api_port: 17778
verify_ssl: true
additional_properties:
  - Location
  - OwningGroup
  - Tenant
  - SiteID
```

The `additional_properties` option is a list of column names from `Cirrus.Nodes` that you want to group the inventory by. The plugin automatically retrieves these fields from `Cirrus.Nodes`:

  * `AgentIP`
  * `SysName`
  * `ConnectionProfile`
  * `MachineType`
  * `OSVersion`
  * `OSImage`

It uses `SysName` for the `ansible_host` variable and will attempt to retrieve the `ConnectionProfile` information for each device and set the `ansible_user`, `ansible_password`, and `ansible_become_password` for each device with the information from the associated profile.

You can use the inventory just like any other. This command will print an inventory graph to your screen of all the hosts and groups they belong to.

```bash
ansible-inventory -i solarwinds_inventory.yml --graph --ask-vault-pass
```
